## üçç Pinapple - An old school Macintosh-inspired file system on the web

Pinapple is a browser-based file system that supports all file types. You can create folders, drag items, add, and delete. Just like you would on an old Macintosh. 

### Why does this exist?

This is a demonstration of what you can do with the [Pinata Files API](https://pinata.cloud). The entire app is powered by this API. There is no database, and the only other dependency is Clerk for authentication. 

Also, it's fun. 

### Credits

The app is built using the incredible [system.css stylesheet](https://github.com/sakofchit/system.css/tree/main) and Tailwind CSS. Icons were created by scratch by Pinata's amazing designer, Marjorie Doucet, and made to look as close to original Macintosh icons as possible.
