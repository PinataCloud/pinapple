## üçç Pinapple - An old school Macintosh-inspired file system on the web

Pinapple is a browser-based file system that supports all file types. You can create folders, drag items, add, and delete. Just like you would on an old Macintosh. 

### Why does this exist?

This is a demonstration of what you can do with the [Pinata Files API](https://pinata.cloud). The entire app is powered by this API. There is no database, and the only other dependency is Clerk for authentication. 

Also, it's fun.
